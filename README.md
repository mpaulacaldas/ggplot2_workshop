# Drawing Anything with ggplot2

*Workshop material*

This repository collects material for a ~4 hour workshop first taught at celebRation2020 in Copenhagen

## MarÃ­a Paula's notes

- :exploding_head: `count()` has a `name` argument.
- `after_stat()` replaces `stat()`, which in turn had replaced things like `..prop..`.
- For bubble charts, `scale_radius()` > `scale_size()` > `scale_size_area()`
